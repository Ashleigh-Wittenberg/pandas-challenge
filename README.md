Module 4 Python-Pandas Challenge

Completed by: Ashleigh Wittenberg

In this assignment, I created and manipulated Pandas DataFrames to analyze school and standardized test data.

First, I performed the necessary calculations and then created a high-level snapshot of the district's key metrics in a DataFrame. 

Then I perform the necessary calculations and then create a DataFrame that summarizes key metrics about each school.

Next, I calculated the highest and lowest performing schools based on the % overall passing data.

Then I created 2 DataFrames. One with the math scores by grade and the other with the reading scores by grade.

Then I created a table that breaks down school performance based on average spending ranges (per student).

Next, I created a DataFrame called that breaks down school performance based on school size.

Lastly, I created a DataFrame showing the school performance based on the school type.
